# Creating Custom VPC with Public and Private Subnets

## Step 1: Navigate to VPC Dashboard
- Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC dashboard.
- Click on "Your VPCs" in the navigation pane.

## Step 2: Create VPC
- Click on the "Create VPC" button.
- Enter the details for your VPC:
  - **Name tag**: Provide a name for your VPC.
  - **IPv4 CIDR block**: Enter the CIDR block for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
  - Click "Create."

## Step 3: Create Subnets
- After creating the VPC, click on "Subnets" in the navigation pane.
- Click on "Create subnet."
- Enter the details for your public subnet:
  - **Name tag**: Provide a name for your subnet.
  - **VPC**: Select the VPC you created in the previous step.
  - **Availability Zone**: Choose an availability zone.
  - **IPv4 CIDR block**: Enter the CIDR block for your public subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
  - Click "Create."
- Repeat the above steps to create the private subnet:
  - Use a different CIDR block for the private subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24).
  - Ensure that the "Auto-assign IPv4" option is disabled for the private subnet.

## Step 4: Create Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Click on "Internet Gateways" in the navigation pane.
- Click on "Create internet gateway."
- Provide a name for the internet gateway and click "Create."
- Select the newly created internet gateway and click "Attach to VPC." Choose the VPC created earlier and click "Attach."

## Step 5: Configure Route Tables
- Click on "Route Tables" in the navigation pane.
- Select the route table associated with the public subnet.
- Click on the "Routes" tab, then "Edit routes."
- Add a route with destination `0.0.0.0/0` and target the internet gateway created earlier.
- Save the changes.
- Repeat the above steps for the private subnet's route table, but do not add a route to the internet gateway.

## Step 6: Associate Subnets with Route Tables
- Click on "Subnet associations" for the public route table and associate the public subnet.
- Repeat the above step for the private route table and associate the private subnet.
