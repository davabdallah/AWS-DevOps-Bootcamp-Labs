## Lab 3: Implement IAM Policies for Access Control

### Objective
Create an IAM user and implement IAM policies to control access, allowing the user to create S3 buckets with objects.

### Steps

1. **Create an IAM Policy for S3 Access:**
   - Go to "IAM" in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select "Policies" from the navigation pane.
   - Click "Create policy."
   - Choose "JSON" and enter the following policy, replacing `"YOUR-BUCKET-NAME"` with the desired bucket name:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:CreateBucket",
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
                   "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
               ]
           },
           {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
       ]
   }



2. **Create an IAM User:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to "IAM" (Identity and Access Management).
   - Select "Users" from the navigation pane.
   - Click "Add user."
   - Enter a username, select "AWS Management Console access."
   - Choose a custom password or auto-generate one.
   - Attach the new created policy to the user.
   - Complete the user creation process.


  3. **Test the policy:**
   - Login with the new created user
   - Go to S3.
   - Try to create a new S3. "It should give a permission error"
   - Try to access your buckt.
